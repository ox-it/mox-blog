Just a quick update here from the offices of Mobile Oxford - but if
you're a member of Oxford University and develop websites in Python,
you'll undoubtedly find it more useful from time-to-time to represent
dates in Oxford format - Term, Week, Year, as opposed to a typical
calendar date. We've had the same issue, and developed some code to
handle this for us - providing us Django template tags for direct use
inside Mobile Oxford, as well as a more abstract library other code may
find useful.

We've put this on `Github`_, as well as on `PyPI`_, for you to use and
enjoy!
