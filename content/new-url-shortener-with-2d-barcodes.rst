New URL shortener with 2D barcodes

We've just added a link shortener to Mobile Oxford, accessible from a
link at the bottom of every page.

In this case we've shortened a link from
http://m.ox.ac.uk/places/osm:N231413379/ to http://m.ox.ac.uk/237,
greatly reducing the potential for error when sharing the link.

We've made sure that most of the links are entirely numeric, making them
easy to type them into a phone without a full keyboard.

You can also easily share the page you're looking at by scanning the
barcode with another phone's barcode reader.
