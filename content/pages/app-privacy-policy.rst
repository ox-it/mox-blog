Privacy Policy
==============

:slug: app-privacy-policy

The Mobile Oxford app does not collect personal information. We do use Google
Analytics to collect general anonymous information about which screens are used
most frequently so that we can improve user experience in the future.

Android Permissions
-------------------

Mobile Oxford requests permissions to read your address book and add/edit your
contacts. This is for the Contact Search feature which allows users to write
University contacts directly to their personal phonebook. We **do not** read
from your contacts at any point and only use this to add new contacts.

Android also has a `small quirk
<http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#READ_CALL_LOG>`__
where requesting access to ``READ_CONTACTS`` automatically adds permissions for
"read call log" and "write call log". Mobile Oxford *does not* access either of
these functions.
