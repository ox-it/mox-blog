| Are you an Oxford student who'd like to help shape the future of
| Oxford's mobile web services? Apply today at
| http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/publicity/internships/index.xml (we're third
| down) to work paid at Oxford University Computing Services for eight
| weeks this summer.

Some of the blurb:

| "Working with the small but dynamic Mobile Oxford team, you will have
| a good knowledge of Python preferably with experience of the Django
| framework upon which Mobile Oxford is built. You will be required to
| take initiative in solving both technical and social problems
| encountered whilst enhancing the codebase and contributing to the
| Molly Project developer lists. Creative solutions are a must and to
| help foster this, one day per week will be assigned to your own
| personal project involving technologies related to mobile computing.

| There will be many sections of the project where you will be able to
| work and we will best tailor the work to suit your abilities and
| interests. Planned enhancements include a fully AJAX/HTML5 skin and UI
| optimisation, further development of our RESTfull interface and native
| platform (e.g. iPhone/Android) app development as well as integration
| with other university and local data services.

| The sucessful candidate will have the opportunity to help mould both
| an international open source project in a rapidly expanding industry
| sector, as well as directly affect the course of a service designed to
| be accessible by almost anyone in the city and University of Oxford."

| Drop in your CV before May 7th to be considered.
