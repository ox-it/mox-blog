I'm not too convinced that Microsoft Tag is a great idea as it seems
to be a relatively closed platform and redirects via Microsoft Servers
(which does however give us statistics). But we've created one for
completeness and also because it's colourful and supposedly better at
dealing with poor focus.

I should note - that this is a form of Barcode and you need a Microsoft
tag application to read it which you can get via your mobile phone
from: `http://gettag.mobi <http://gettag.mobi>`_
