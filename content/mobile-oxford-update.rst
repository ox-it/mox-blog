:summary: Recent developments from the Mobile Oxford project the today view,
          events and personalisation.

As you may know, we've been working on an updated version of Mobile
Oxford for some time now. We're really happy with the progress and wanted to
share a preview of some of the new features before we launch.

The Today view
--------------

This new view to Mobile Oxford hopes to bring together all the information
relevant to you, based upon your current context. For example, if you're
outside the train station we want to show you the live departure board. If
you've favourited your bus stops to and from work we'll show the real time
departure information for them front and centre. 

We hope this becomes a one-stop shop for lots of existing Mobile Oxford users,
particularly if you're a commuter.

Other information we're showing on the Today view currently includes: the
amount of free spaces at each of the Park & Rides, events going on in Oxford
for the day, the rowing information for each river and the term date of the
University.

Personalisation
---------------

Obviously not everyone using Mobile Oxford is a student, uses the Park & Ride,
and is a keen rower. We know some of this information might be irrelevant for
you and now you can personalise the home screen to your convenience. Clicking
the settings button will allow you add/remove cards from the Today view.

Beyond this, whilst you're using Mobile Oxford and favourite train stations,
park & ride, bus stops etc we'll show the real-time information for each on the
Today view. We're also allowing you to give your own name to each, so
rather than "C3 Magdalen Street" you can have something more relevant to you
for example: "Bus home, outside Tesco". Click the edit button from the
"Favourites" view to rename any of your favourites right there.

Events
------

We've also added an entirely new "Events" app which lists all the events
happening today and later in the week on a single view.

All the events are being sourced from `Oxford Talks <http://talks.ox.ac.uk>`__
the primary source for what's going on at the University.

iOS and Android
---------------

We'll also be offering apps for Android and iOS. If you'd like to try them out
before they're on the app stores then get in touch.

Try it out & provide Feedback
-----------------------------

Our "in development" version is available at
`new.m.ox.ac.uk <http://new.m.ox.ac.uk>`__. There are several bugs we're aware
of and even more which we are not. Given that caveat, anyone is welcome to
start using the new Mobile Oxford as they please.

If you'd like to send feedback on these points or any aspect of the project
feel free to email the team at mobileoxford@it.ox.ac.uk.
