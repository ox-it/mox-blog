Mobile Oxford update
====================

As you may know, we've been working on an updated version of Mobile
Oxford for some time now. We're really happy with the progress and wanted to
share a preview of some of the new features before we launch.

The Today view
--------------

This new view to Mobile Oxford hopes to bring together all the information
relevant to you, based upon your current context. For example, if you're
outside the train station we want to show you the live departure board. If
you've favourited your bus stops to and from work we'll show the real time
departure information for them front and centre. We hope this becomes a
one-stop shop for lots of existing Mobile Oxford users, particularly if you're
a commuter.

Other information we're showing on the Today view currently includes. The
amount of free spaces at each of the five Park & Rides surrounding Oxford.
All the events going on in Oxford for the day, the rowing information for each
river and the term date of the University.

Personalisation
---------------

The design of the Today view affords us a lot of flexibility in what we show
you. So whilst you're using Mobile Oxford and favourite your, train station,
park & ride, bus stops, we'll show the real-time information for each on the
Today view. Along with this we allow you to give your own name to each, so
rather than "C3 Magdalen Street" you can have something more relevant to you
for example: "Bus home, outside Tesco".

We have a lot planned in the way of personalisation, currently we've only
scratched the surface of what's possible. We hope to allow users to fully
tailor the today view to their own usage of Mobile Oxford. We're aware you
aren't all keen rowers interested in the safety flag status of the Isis and
Godstow :-)

iOS and Android
---------------

We'll also be offering apps for Android and iOS. If you'd like to try them out
before they're on the app stores then get in touch.

Try it out & provide Feedback
-----------------------------

Our "in development" version is available at
`new.m.ox.ac.uk<http://new.m.ox.ac.uk>`__. There are several bugs we're aware
of and even more which we are not. Given that caveat, anyone is welcome to
start using the new Mobile Oxford as they please.

If you'd like to send feedback on these points or any aspect of the project
feel free to email the team at mobileoxford@it.ox.ac.uk.
