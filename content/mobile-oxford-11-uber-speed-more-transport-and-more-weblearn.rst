Mobile Oxford 1.1 is now live!

**Speed**

.. image:: |filename|/images/speed.png 

We've heavily optimised our cache headers to tell your phone what to
store and for how long so you need not re-load regularly. Added to this
you'll also benefit from the speed that our new AJAX loading system
provides so that the entire page does not need to be re-created every
time you click through.

**Transport improvements**

Bus stop groups - we now group bus stops with nearby ones, this means if
you navigate to one bus stop in a particular area you'll also get the
real time bus information for the nearby stops. This is particularly
useful if you have a choice of buses from a particular area or if you
can't remember which bus stop yours is!

Rail replacement bus departures are now shown on railway departure
boards.

**Weblearn**

You can now answer Surveys on Weblearn, just navigate to
Weblearn->Surveys and answer any surveys you have available to answer.
We also now have site announcements displayed on the first Weblearn page
to let you know of anything urgent!

**Many more!**

There are dozens of other changes which you can read all about
