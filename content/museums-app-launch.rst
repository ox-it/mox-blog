This was a joint effort between us in the Mobile Oxford team and Ted Koterwas
from `InfoDev <http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/infodev/>`__. If you're interested in
how we built the application see our blog post on `building offline JavaScript
apps </posts/2013/05/29/preloading-javascript-applications/>`__. We hope you
enjoy the app!
