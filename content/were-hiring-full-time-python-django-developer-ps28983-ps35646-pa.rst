| devise and implement new ideas, pushing them out as a live service

| clever ways of interfacing with other University systems.

| Of course you will also need to be good at listening to users (and
| dealing with their responses appropriately) and testing new gadgets
| around the city to see how to make them work better with our service.

| Working for Oxford University Computing Services, you'll find it
| provides an environment that gives room for creative thinking, as well
| as the opportunity to learn new skills along the way.
