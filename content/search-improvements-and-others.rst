Hello all,

It's been a while since we've properly updated you with what's been
going on, but I assure you, we've been very busy behind the scenes! In
addition to rolling out new features like OUCS Status (shows you the
status computing services systems) and of course our new look which
works across every smartphone platform (except for Windows Mobile at
present), we have also been implementing authenticated access. What
does this mean? It means that soon, you'll be able to access tools in
the University's WebLearn service (if you're a member of course) and
other 'core' services in the near future.

As always, we welcome your thoughts, suggestions, criticisms and data
so please do drop us a line at mobileoxford@oucs.ox.ac.uk

In the mean time, let me introduce you to a few improvements to our
Universal search feature. As you may know, the little search box at
the top of the home page lets you search for pretty much anything
across Mobile Oxford. This includes the name of a location e.g.
"Phoenix" will bring you the Phoenix cinema, an Oxontime busstop
number will take you straight to that bus stop etc.

What's new:
1. Postcodes - Enter a postcode and Mobile Oxford will show you a list
of things near to that location
2. OUCS Unit Codes - Like postcodes, Mobile Oxford will recognise OUCS
Unit codes e.g. 'kebl' and show you a map of Keble College and an
option to find things near to it.

Other Search Features:
3. Bus Stop Numbers: Enter an Oxontime number e.g. 69345648 (you can
also leave out the leading 693) or a central stop reference e.g. R3
and Mobile Oxford will take you straight to its realtime bus times and
a map.
4. Books: Type in an ISBN/ISSN, Mobile Oxford will detect it and
automatically run a library search for you.
5. General: In addition to searching the whole site, it does also let
you have a 'two step' search for library books and contacts by name
e.g. if you enter 'John Smith', the following page will give you an
option at the bottom to search for that name as a contact or a book.

Stay tuned for a lot more!
