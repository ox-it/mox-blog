Search Improvements and others
##############################

Hello all,

| It's been a while since we've properly updated you with what's been
| going on, but I assure you, we've been very busy behind the scenes! In
| addition to rolling out new features like OUCS Status (shows you the
| status computing services systems) and of course our new look which
| works across every smartphone platform (except for Windows Mobile at
| present), we have also been implementing authenticated access. What
| does this mean? It means that soon, you'll be able to access tools in
| the University's WebLearn service (if you're a member of course) and
| other 'core' services in the near future.

| As always, we welcome your thoughts, suggestions, criticisms and data
| so please do drop us a line at mobileoxford@oucs.ox.ac.uk

| In the mean time, let me introduce you to a few improvements to our
| Universal search feature. As you may know, the little search box at
| the top of the home page lets you search for pretty much anything
| across Mobile Oxford. This includes the name of a location e.g.
| "Phoenix" will bring you the Phoenix cinema, an Oxontime busstop
| number will take you straight to that bus stop etc.

| What's new:
| 1. Postcodes - Enter a postcode and Mobile Oxford will show you a list
| of things near to that location
| 2. OUCS Unit Codes - Like postcodes, Mobile Oxford will recognise OUCS
| Unit codes e.g. 'kebl' and show you a map of Keble College and an
| option to find things near to it.

| Other Search Features:
| 3. Bus Stop Numbers: Enter an Oxontime number e.g. 69345648 (you can
| also leave out the leading 693) or a central stop reference e.g. R3
| and Mobile Oxford will take you straight to its realtime bus times and
| a map.
| 4. Books: Type in an ISBN/ISSN, Mobile Oxford will detect it and
| automatically run a library search for you.
| 5. General: In addition to searching the whole site, it does also let
| you have a 'two step' search for library books and contacts by name
| e.g. if you enter 'John Smith', the following page will give you an
| option at the bottom to search for that name as a contact or a book.

Stay tuned for a lot more!
