Mobile Oxford 1.0 has arrived
#############################

It's been a long time coming, but we've finally put together a release
we think worthy of the "1.0" tag. You may not notice a massive
difference, but there's been lots of bug fixes and performance
improvements, which should make the dreaded "500" error screens a lot
less likely. Geolocating is now also a lot more reliable, as well as our
integration into Weblearn.

One of the biggest changes will only be for Android and iPhone users,
but these users will notice a large difference in the speed for the
site, using a new HTML5 feature called a 'cache manifest'.

Some changes you will notice include:

A redesigned library app, showing you all shelfmarks and availability on
one page:

Arrivals boards for train stations:

Phone numbers for certain places:

And the names of bus stops in Mobile Oxford have changed to better
reflect the name shown on the bus stops themselves.Â We also now formally
support Kindles!

Hopefully you'll enjoy these changes, and we're always keen to hear
feedback, which you can send using the links on every page on the site!
