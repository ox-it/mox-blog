dev8d came along before I was quite ready for it. I'd glanced quickly at
the program, but only noticed a bunch of unfamiliar acronyms. I had a
nagging feeling that I was going to be a very non-technical fish in the
geekiest pond in town. In the car on the way down, however, I started to
actually read the program and began to realise that behind the acronyms
there were actually some really interesting projects.

We arrived on Tuesday evening and, by the end of the car journey, I had
marked far more sessions than I was going to be able to attend. An
embarrassment of techie riches, including things which promised to take
me way back to a mis-spent youth of hardware hackery; brought bang up to
date and involving RFID and open hardware amongst other things. I had to
juggle things a bit so that I would be able to help out with our project
workshops (which is, after all, why we were here), but otherwise I'd
lined up a pretty interesting program for myself.

After a reasonably comfortable night at the Wembley Plaza (which is
every bit as nice a place as it sounds), we caught a very crowded tube
into town and were soon at the venue. My expectations began to mellow
when I spotted the huge platters of Danish pastries and giant urns of
coffee in the basecamp room. These people obviously knew their audience!
The basecamp hall has plenty of seating, plenty of power strips, eduroam
wireless network (eduroam is so satisfyingly painless to use across the
country that seeing it on the list of available networks is as
comfortable and reassuring as meeting an old friend). After getting
connected, firing off some first impression tweets (under the
@mollyproject account) and uploading a few pics to my Dev8D set on
Flickr, the day kicked off with some quick introductory talks which were
pitched at a nice informal level. It seems that this was going to be the
prevailing ethos of the event; come and go from sessions as you please,
pick up in the middle, leave if you're bored, la de dah, do as thou wilt
shall be the whole of the conference program.

So, after the pastries and coffee came Arduino; a nice, simple, open,
cheap, and well supported little microprocessor board which you can use
to make, well, whatever you like really. I worked through the examples
(somewhat disappointed that there was no soldering involved - I really
like the smell of solder flux...) and picked up enough of the control
code to feel confident with it, and even had enough time in the session
to play around with some examples of our own (including a rudimentary
theremin). My brain was already working ahead and sourcing the hardware
so that I could carry this on at home after the conference. I love it
when you come out of a session buzzing with creative possibilities.

Unbelievable, but that was the morning gone already and now lunch, a
really spectacularly good lunch, was now being served downstairs. The
clink of cutlery punctuated the steady flow of conversation. It seems
that a lot of people had been similarly inspired by their morning
sessions.

After lunch I attended a short series of lightening talks, which
included some stuff about OAI-PMH; the protocol that refuses to die,
which gave me flash-backs to my first stumbling forays into XML After
the talks came our first workshop session and I'm here now writing this
entry while I should probably be paying attention. I hope nobody asks me
anything more complicated than "which way to the coffee?"
