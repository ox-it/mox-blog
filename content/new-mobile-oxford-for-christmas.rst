:date: 2010-12-24 20:00

Just before Christmas we were pleased to release a new version of Mobile
Oxford which with a sack full of bug fixes also brought in a few major
new features.

**Transport Page**

With one click/touch you can now access a wealth of transport
information from around Oxford including the current capacity of all
five of Oxford's Park and Rides, real time bus information from your
nearest (or favourite) bus stops, live train departure information and
BBC Oxfordshire Travel alerts. 

**Favourites**

You can now 'favourite' many pages across the site giving you quick
access from the front page, additionally any bus stops you favourite
will appear in your transport page with real time bus information. To
favourite a page, simply look for the grey star at the top right - click
on this and your page will have been favourited. 

**Weblearn**

Our integration with Weblearn has been improved considerably and is fast
reaching the status of no longer being a 'Preview'. On January 10th
Weblearn will turn on a few more features which means that the Polls and
Sign ups tool will be fully functional then!
